# Ask Me Anything

Hi, I’m Sophie. Use this repository to ask me anything.

For this idea, I got inspired by Harry´s (@csswizardy) AMA-repository. Just a small project to get to more experience with git and GitHub. 

Feel free to ask me anything at all: careers, business, code, tooling, setup, workflows, etc. Just keep it sensible, polite, and clean. You can ask me a question by submitting a pull request or by opening an issue. The latter is preferable, because I can categorize and color-code the questions there.


You can read more about me on [my website](https://www.sophieschoice.net), and [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sophies_choice).
